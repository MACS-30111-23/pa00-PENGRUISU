For this assignment, you will submit TWO files -- the readme and the script file. 


Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)

## About Me

I am a passionate student with a keen interest in Economics. I love exploring new technologies and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

### Experience

- **Education:** Completed my degree in Economics and Finance from CUHKSZ.
- **MASTER:** Currently study at UCHICAGO.

### Interests

- **Programming:** Love coding in languages like Python.
- **Reading:** Enjoy reading books on history.
- **Travel:** Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures.

## Reflection on Git/GitHub Workflow

For this homework, I adopted a structured Git/GitHub workflow which involved:
1. **Cloning the Repository:** I started by cloning the repository to my local machine.
2. **Creating a Branch:** I created a new branch for the changes I wanted to make.
3. **Making Changes:** I edited the README file to include my biography and added a profile picture.
4. **Adding, Committing, and Pushing:** I added and committed my changes, and then pushed them to my forked repository.
5. **Pull Request:** Finally, I submitted a pull request to the original repository for review and merging.

### Markdown Experience

Markdown proved to be a versatile and user-friendly language for formatting text. I found the syntax easy to learn and use, particularly for creating headers, lists, emphasis with italics and bold, embedding images, and adding links. One surprising aspect was how quickly I could create well-formatted documents with Markdown.
